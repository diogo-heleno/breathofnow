# Build Command

Please run a clean production build:

1. First, check for any TypeScript errors with `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
3. If there are errors, fix them before proceeding
4. Run `npm run build` to create the production build
5. Report the build results including:
   - Build success/failure
   - Any warnings
   - Bundle size information if available
   - Pages generated

If the build fails, analyze the errors and suggest fixes.
