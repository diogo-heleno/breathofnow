# Test Command

Please run the test suite:

1. Check if test framework is configured (look for jest.config or vitest.config)
2. If no test framework exists, suggest setting one up
3. If tests exist, run `npm test` or the appropriate test command
4. Report:
   - Number of tests passed/failed
   - Any failing test details
   - Code coverage if available
5. If tests fail, analyze the failures and suggest fixes
