# Development Server Command

Please start the development environment:

1. Check if any process is already running on port 3000
2. If port is busy, offer to kill the existing process or use a different port
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server with Turbopack
4. The server will be available at http://localhost:3000
5. Watch the output for any compilation errors

Note: The dev server runs with Turbopack for faster hot reload.
