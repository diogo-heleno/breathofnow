# TypeScript Check Command

Please check the TypeScript types in the project:

1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors without emitting files
2. If there are errors:
   - List all type errors grouped by file
   - Explain each error briefly
   - Fix the errors one by one
   - Re-run the type check to verify fixes
3. Report the final type check status

Focus on fixing actual type issues, not adding unnecessary type annotations.
