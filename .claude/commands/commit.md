# Git Commit Command

Please help me commit my changes:

1. Run `git status` to see all modified and untracked files
2. Run `git diff` to review the changes
3. Add all relevant files to staging (exclude any sensitive files like .env)
4. Draft a commit message following conventional commits format:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `style:` for formatting changes
   - `test:` for adding tests
5. The commit message should be concise but descriptive (1-2 sentences max)
6. Execute the git commit
7. Show the result of `git status` after committing

Do NOT push to remote - only commit locally.
