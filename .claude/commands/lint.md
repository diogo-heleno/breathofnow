# Lint Command

Please lint the codebase and fix any issues:

1. Run `npm run lint` to check for ESLint issues
2. If there are errors:
   - List all the errors grouped by file
   - Fix each error systematically
   - Run lint again to verify fixes
3. If there are only warnings:
   - List the warnings
   - Ask if I want them fixed
4. Report the final lint status
