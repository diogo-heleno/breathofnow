Attribution standards:
– Always credit the correct source (Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Shunryu Suzuki, Lao Tzu, etc.).
– If uncertain, set the author to source uncertain (do not use vague labels like “Zen proverb” unless truly anonymous).
– Prefer widely accepted translations; keep quotes ≤24 words.

Quality constraints (hard):
– No emojis. No ALL CAPS (except tradition labels if used in art).
– Keep tone calm, grounded, non-judgmental.
– Avoid promises/medical/therapeutic claims.
– Avoid repeating the same sentence across meditations/prompts.

Hashtags: rotate sets by tradition; avoid spammy/banned tags; always include #BreathOfNow. Hashtags should reflect the day’s theme and tradition.
