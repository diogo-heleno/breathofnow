        "answer": "By default, all your data is stored locally on your device using your browser's storage. This means your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly enable cloud backup."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the apps offline?",
        "answer": "Yes! All our apps work fully offline. Some features like syncing Strava data or fetching current stock prices require internet, but the core functionality works without it."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I clear my browser data?",
        "answer": "If you clear your browser data, your app data will be deleted. We recommend enabling cloud backup or regularly exporting your data to prevent data loss."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Pay What You Want work?",
        "answer": "We suggest a price based on your region's cost of living, but you're free to pay more or less. If you're a student or facing financial difficulties, feel free to pay less. If you can afford more, your extra contribution helps us keep building."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I switch between free and paid?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can upgrade to remove ads and unlock premium features anytime. If you cancel your subscription, you'll keep access until the end of your billing period, then return to the free tier."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's included in the Founding Member plan?",
        "answer": "The Founding Member plan (€599 one-time) gives you lifetime access to ALL apps and ALL future versions forever. You also get early access to new features, your name in our Hall of Fame, quarterly Q&A sessions with the founder, priority feature requests, and direct support via Discord. It's limited to the first 100 members."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you have a mobile app?",

        "question": "How do I contact support?",
